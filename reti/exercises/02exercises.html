	<p> P3. Consider an HTTP client that wants to retrieve a Web document at a given
	URL. The IP address of the HTTP server is initially unknown. What transport
	and application-layer protocols besides HTTP are needed in this scenario?</p>

	<p>P6. Obtain the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616). Answer the following questions:
	a. Explain the mechanism used for signaling between the client and server
	to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed. Can the client, the
	server, or both signal the close of a connection?
	b. What encryption services are provided by HTTP?
	c. Can a client open three or more simultaneous connections with a given
	server?
	d. Either a server or a client may close a transport connection between them
	if either one detects the connection has been idle for some time. Is it possible
	that one side starts closing a connection while the other side is transmitting
	data via this connection? Explain.</p>

	<p>P7. Suppose within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page.
	The IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so a
	DNS lookup is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that n DNS
	servers are visited before your host receives the IP address from DNS; the
	successive visits incur an RTT of RTT1, . . ., RTTn. Further suppose that the
	Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, consisting of a
	small amount of HTML text. Let RTT0 denote the RTT between the local host
	and the server containing the object. Assuming zero transmission time of the
	object, how much time elapses from when the client clicks on the link until
	the client receives the object?</p>

	<p>P8. Referring to Problem P7, suppose the HTML file references eight very small
	objects on the same server. Neglecting transmission times, how much time
	elapses with<br>
	a. Non-persistent HTTP with no parallel TCP connections?<br>
	b. Non-persistent HTTP with the browser configured for 5 parallel connections?<br>
	c. Persistent HTTP?</p>

	<p>P10. Consider a short, 10-meter link, over which a sender can transmit at a rate of
	150 bits/sec in both directions. Suppose that packets containing data are
	100,000 bits long, and packets containing only control (e.g., ACK or handshaking)
	are 200 bits long. Assume that N parallel connections each get 1/N
	of the link bandwidth. Now consider the HTTP protocol, and suppose that
	each downloaded object is 100 Kbits long, and that the initial downloaded
	object contains 10 referenced objects from the same sender. Would parallel
	downloads via parallel instances of non-persistent HTTP make sense in this
	case? Now consider persistent HTTP. Do you expect significant gains over
	the non-persistent case? Justify and explain your answer.</p>

	<p>P11. Consider the scenario introduced in the previous problem. Now suppose that
	the link is shared by Bob with four other users. Bob uses parallel instances of
	non-persistent HTTP, and the other four users use non-persistent HTTP without
	parallel downloads.<br>
	a. Do Bob’s parallel connections help him get Web pages more quickly?
	Why or why not?<br>
	b. If all five users open five parallel instances of non-persistent HTTP, then
	would Bob’s parallel connections still be beneficial? Why or why not?</p>

	<p>P12. Write a simple TCP program for a server that accepts lines of input from a
	client and prints the lines onto the server’s standard output. (You can do this by
	modifying the TCPServer.py program in the text.) Compile and execute your
	program. On any other machine that contains a Web browser, set the proxy
	server in the browser to the host that is running your server program; also configure
	the port number appropriately. Your browser should now send its GET
	request messages to your server, and your server should display the messages
	on its standard output. Use this platform to determine whether your browser
	generates conditional GET messages for objects that are locally cached.</p>

	<p>P18. a. What is a whois database?<br>
	b. Use various whois databases on the Internet to obtain the names of two
	DNS servers. Indicate which whois databases you used.<br>
	c. Use nslookup on your local host to send DNS queries to three DNS servers:
	your local DNS server and the two DNS servers you found in part (b). Try
	querying for Type A, NS, and MX reports. Summarize your findings.<br>
	d. Use nslookup to find a Web server that has multiple IP addresses. Does
	the Web server of your institution (school or company) have multiple IP
	addresses?<br>
	e. Use the ARIN whois database to determine the IP address range used by
	your university.<br>
	f. Describe how an attacker can use whois databases and the nslookup tool
	to perform reconnaissance on an institution before launching an attack.<br>
	g. Discuss why whois databases should be publicly available.</p>

	<p>P26. Suppose Bob joins a BitTorrent torrent, but he does not want to upload any
	data to any other peers (so called free-riding).<br>
	a. Bob claims that he can receive a complete copy of the file that is shared
	by the swarm. Is Bob’s claim possible? Why or why not?<br>
	b. Bob further claims that he can further make his “free-riding” more efficient
	by using a collection of multiple computers (with distinct IP
	addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How can he do that?</p>
