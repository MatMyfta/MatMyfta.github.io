	<p>P3. Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the
	sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and
	fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a
	relatively long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly justifying
	your answer:<br>
	a. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more
	appropriate for this application? Why?<br>
	b. Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the only traffic in
	this network comes from such applications as described above. Furthermore,
	assume that the sum of the application data rates is less than the
	capacities of each and every link. Is some form of congestion control
	needed? Why?</p>

	<p>P7. In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B
	over a packet-switched network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a
	digital 64 kbps bit stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte
	packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its transmission rate is 2
	Mbps and its propagation delay is 10 msec. As soon as Host A gathers a
	packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it
	converts the packet’s bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses from
	the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A) until the
	bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B)?</p>

	<p>P10. Consider a packet of length L which begins at end system A and travels over
	three links to a destination end system. These three links are connected by
	two packet switches. Let di, si, and Ri denote the length, propagation speed,
	and the transmission rate of link i, for i = 1, 2, 3. The packet switch delays
	each packet by dproc. Assuming no queuing delays, in terms of di, si, Ri,
	(i = 1,2,3), and L, what is the total end-to-end delay for the packet? Suppose
	now the packet is 1,500 bytes, the propagation speed on all three links is 2.5 ·
	108 m/s, the transmission rates of all three links are 2 Mbps, the packet switch
	processing delay is 3 msec, the length of the first link is 5,000 km, the length
	of the second link is 4,000 km, and the length of the last link is 1,000 km. For
	these values, what is the end-to-end delay?</p>

	<p>P11. In the above problem, suppose R1 = R2 = R3 = R and dproc = 0. Further suppose
	the packet switch does not store-and-forward packets but instead immediately
	transmits each bit it receives before waiting for the entire packet to
	arrive. What is the end-to-end delay?</p>

	<p>P12. A packet switch receives a packet and determines the outbound link to which
	the packet should be forwarded. When the packet arrives, one other packet is
	halfway done being transmitted on this outbound link and four other packets
	are waiting to be transmitted. Packets are transmitted in order of arrival.
	Suppose all packets are 1,500 bytes and the link rate is 2 Mbps. What is the
	queuing delay for the packet? More generally, what is the queuing delay
	when all packets have length L, the transmission rate is R, x bits of the
	currently-being-transmitted packet have been transmitted, and n packets are
	already in the queue?</p>

	<p>P15. Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at a link in packets/sec, and let μ
	denote the link’s transmission rate in packets/sec. Based on the formula for
	the total delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) derived in
	the previous problem, derive a formula for the total delay in terms of a and μ.</p>	

	<p>P16. Consider a router buffer preceding an outbound link. In this problem, you will
	use Little’s formula, a famous formula from queuing theory. Let N denote the
	average number of packets in the buffer plus the packet being transmitted. Let
	a denote the rate of packets arriving at the link. Let d denote the average total
	delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) experienced by a
	packet. Little’s formula is N = a · d. Suppose that on average, the buffer contains
	10 packets, and the average packet queuing delay is 10 msec. The link’s
	transmission rate is 100 packets/sec. Using Little’s formula, what is the average
	packet arrival rate, assuming there is no packet loss?</p>

	<p>P18. Perform a Traceroute between source and destination on the same continent
	at three different hours of the day.<br>
	a. Find the average and standard deviation of the round-trip delays at each of
	the three hours.<br>
	b. Find the number of routers in the path at each of the three hours. Did the
	paths change during any of the hours?<br>
	c. Try to identify the number of ISP networks that the Traceroute packets pass
	through from source to destination. Routers with similar names and/or similar
	IP addresses should be considered as part of the same ISP. In your experiments,
	do the largest delays occur at the peering interfaces between adjacent ISPs?<br>
	d. Repeat the above for a source and destination on different continents.
	Compare the intra-continent and inter-continent results</p>

	<p>P24. Suppose you would like to urgently deliver 40 terabytes data from Boston to
	Los Angeles. You have available a 100 Mbps dedicated link for data transfer.
	Would you prefer to transmit the data via this link or instead use FedEx overnight
	delivery? Explain.</p>

	<p>P33. Consider sending a large file of F bits from Host Ato Host B. There are three
	links (and two switches) between Aand B, and the links are uncongested (that
	is, no queuing delays). Host Asegments the file into segments of S bits each and
	adds 80 bits of header to each segment, forming packets of L = 80 + S bits. Each
	link has a transmission rate of R bps. Find the value of S that minimizes the
	delay of moving the file from Host Ato Host B. Disregard propagation delay.</p>

	<p>P34. Skype offers a service that allows you to make a phone call from a PC to an
	ordinary phone. This means that the voice call must pass through both the
	Internet and through a telephone network. Discuss how this might be done.</p>
