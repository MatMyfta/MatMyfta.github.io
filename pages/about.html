				I was born in Elbasan (AL) in 1998, until my family and I went to Italy, when I still was very young, and unfortunately now I don't go anymore in Albania very often.
				In Italy we lived in Tuscany for a long time with a large part of my relatives, such as cousins and uncles. But for family reasons we moved to South Tirol -- my current location.

				When I was eight, I bought my first PC and - like all the kids in 2006 - I was the most excited kid when I realized my first <u>artwork</u> with paint. After a while I had finally even a internet connection, so I could get close and be fascinated by the internet world - an entire universe of informations and... <u>games</u> - the main reason I started my career in <i>Google searching</i>. Thanks to Google I found a lot of sites, that made me get close to web site development and graphic design in the near future - starting from free forum hosting - and there it is where I started making web layouts and coding with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.
				<br><br>
				Coding with HTML and CSS was my first step in my coding experience, and one of the most important in my life - actually the one that made me choose the Computer Science High School. In this High School my actual passion for programming and algorithms has started. In the beginning, I was programming with <b>C++</b>, then follow <b>Java</b>, <b>SQL</b> and <b>PHP</b>. Meanwhile I enveloped my skills in graphic design by myself.
				<br><br>
				After that I choose to go on with the studies, and I applied to the Department of Engineering and Science of Information in the University of Trento - where I continue study <b>Computer Science</b>.

				Since I was a child, I always loved films and the cinema world, in particular I like to watch crime, action, dramma films and TV shows. Crime films were the first that made me get close to Computer Science: I always was fascinated by those <i>hackers</i> 👨‍💻 that write super fast with the computers and this was my first dream when I was a child.<br>
				Now film and TV shows watching is actually one of my favourites <del>guily pleasure</del> <i>hobby</i> in my free time. I have an entire list of films and a plenty of TV shows I would love to watch, maybe even with good friends and beer. 🍺<br>
				Some of the TV shows that I really like and I gladly re-watch: 
				<ol type="i" class="paragraph">
					<li>👨🏻 How I met your mother</li>
					<li>👨🏻‍🔬 Dr. House</li>
					<li>🕵🏻‍♂️ Person of Interest</li>
					<li>😈 Lucifer</li>
					<li>🤯 Dark</li>
				</ol>
